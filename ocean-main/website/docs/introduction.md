Ocean is a platform-independent framework that supports all major operating systems including iOS,
Android, Quest, macOS, Windows, and Linux. It is designed to revolutionize the development of
Computer Vision and Mixed Reality applications.

## Open Source and Accessible

Ocean is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/main/LICENSE),
ensuring that it is completely open-source and accessible to developers. By choosing one of the most
permissive licenses available, we aim to empower developers to build, innovate, and transform their
ideas into reality without the constraints of complicated licensing.

## High Performance and Cross-Platform Compatibility

At the heart of Ocean lies a core written in C/C++, optimized for performance and efficiency. This
allows the development of lightweight native applications that can operate smoothly across various
platforms. Whether you're targeting mobile devices or headsets like Meta's Quest, Ocean provides
the tools necessary to create compelling and immersive experiences.

## Rich Set of Features and Demonstrations

Ocean is not just a framework; it's a comprehensive toolkit equipped with numerous demo applications
that showcase its potential. These demos serve as both a learning tool and a source of inspiration
for developers. For instance, one of the standout demos illustrates how to integrate an external
camera, such as a simple webcam, with a Quest device. This enables developers to access live camera
feeds directly on Meta's headsets, opening up a plethora of possibilities for innovative
applications. For details, check out our project website:

## Get Involved

With the Ocean codebase being readily available on GitHub, we're inviting developers from around the
world to explore, contribute, and extend its capabilities. Whether you're looking to prototype new
technologies or develop robust applications, Ocean provides the foundation you need. We believe
that Ocean will open up new horizons in the fields of Computer Vision and Mixed Reality. By
providing a powerful, flexible, and accessible tool, we are excited to see what developers will
create. Dive into Ocean and start building the future today!
